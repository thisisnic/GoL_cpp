# Conway's Game of Life in C++

As a child, I used to love playing with the version of Conway's Game of Life that came with Windows 95.  I didn't really understand it, but had an intuitive grasp of the idea that you had to make sure your cluster of cells didn't end up overpopulated or underpopulated.  Later, when first learning to code, I made a version of this in Java, so it seemed like a great exercise for learning C++.

TODO: Refactor into functions and classes.

This version uses ncurses to display output in the terminal.
